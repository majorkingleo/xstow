   patches on Free-BSD

   on Solaris.

   target dir '/', but all packages should be installed
   in '/usr/local'

*) fixed some bugs

Version 0.4.3

*) fixed 'xstow -dl' crash bug

*) fixed working dir bug

*) improved compatibility with stow, by using
   the same package detection technic, even if I think
   this is a bug, not a feature

   you can configure that absolute links will be automatically
   detected as traversable links.

Version 0.2.0

   /usr/share/man to /usr/man. It can be configured via the xstow.ini
   file. See xstow(1) and xstow.ini(5) for details.
