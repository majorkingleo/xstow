	* configure.ac: I call this Version 1.0.0 now.

	* src/leoini.cpp (find_comment): added the numbersign as comment
	sign in to the ini file parsing code.

	* src/tree.cpp (check): Bug#589860: Ignore does not ignore directories
	Von: Anthony DeRobertis <anthony@derobert.net>
	An: Debian Bug Tracking System <submit@bugs.debian.org>
	Datum: Gestern 20:13:19

	Package: xstow
	Version: 0.5.1-6
	Severity: normal

	--help says -i should ignore files and directories. However, it seems to
	only work on files, and the source code seems to agree...

	if( nn->getType() == FILE )   // <--- doesn't that mean files only?
	{
          if( match_ignore( nn->file.get_name() ) )
          {
              DEBUG( OUT(2)( "file %s ignored\n", CppDir::concat_dir( getFullPathName(), nn->file.get_name() ) ) );
              continue;
          }
	}

	This means its impossible to do a -i .svn, which is quite unforunate.

	| Ari Pollak <ajp@aripollak.com>
	| 
	| Hi, I'm using xstow to manage a large (100+) repository of packages over 
	| NFS.
	| I have the Sun J2SDK v. 1.4.2 that I'm trying to link only certain 
	| directories with (namely bin/, include/, and man/man1/). But I can't, 
	| for the life of me, figure out from the documentation how to do this.
	| How would I go about only linking certain directories when xstowing?

	this resulted in the -nignore option
	
	Ignore everything execpt file and directories matching this expression.
