=head1 NAME

merge-info, merge and unmerge GNU Info index files

=head1 SYNOPSIS

merge-info        [OPTION ...] FILE FILE

=head1 DESCRIPTION

merge-info can merge and unmerge the GNU Info index files named
'dir'. These files are usally created by B<install-info> at install time
of an application, or automatically generated by a B<mkinfodir> script.

If you are installing 2 packages at two different locations, two
different 'dir' files are created. Eg.: One in

	  /stow/foo/usr/local/info/dir 

and one in

	  /stow/bar/usr/local/info/dir 

This is the common case if you are using a tool like
xstow(1). B<merge-info> can handle this and can merge both 'dir'
files and creates a new 'dir' file.

=head1 USAGE

merge-info [OPTION ...] FILE FILE

Merge two files:
      
      merge-info /stow/foo/info/dir /stow/bar/info/dir

Remove the content of a 'dir' file from another 'dir' file

       merge-info -u /stow/foo/info/dir /stow/bar/info/dir

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item B<-dl -debug-level> INT

Set's the debug level. An unsigned integer is accepted. The
default value is 0.

=item B<-h -help> 

Shows a help screen.

=item B<-V -Version>

Displays the verion number of the XStow package. B<merge-info> is
shipped with B<xstow>(1).

#ifdef ENABLE_CURSES
=item B<-C -no-curses>

Do not detect the terminal width by using curses.
#endif

=item B<-u -unmerge>

Unmerge instead of merge. Note: It is not possible splitting up one
'dir' file into two. But removing the content of one 'dir' file from
the other one is possible.

=item B<-o -outfile>

Write the resulting 'dir' file not to stdout. Write it to a given
file. Since B<merge-info> does not open this outfile until all the
merging or unmerging stuff is done it is allowed that the outfile is
one the source files. eg.:

    merge-info -u foo/info/dir bar/info/dir -o foo/info/dir

=item B<-d -duplicate>

Remove duplicate entries. When merging 2 files an entry can appear in
more than one section. If you do not wan't this, use this option.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

=over

=item B<XSTOW_DEBUG_LEVEL>

Same as the B<-debug-level> option.


#ifdef ENABLE_CURSES
=item B<XSTOW_USE_CURSES> 

Same as the B<-no-curses> option.

In previous versions xstow tried detecting the terminal width and height,
by default at the startup routine. Even if this value is only used by
the help screen. The result was:

    $ TERM="" xstow 
    Error opening terminal: unknown.

The error message is reported by the ncurses lib. This can cause problems
if you wan't start xstow as a cron job.
Now xstow tries detecting the terminal width not in it's startup, but
when the help screen is printed out. As an extra option you can set
the environment variable B<XSTOW_USE_CURSES>="0" this will tell xstow
not using curses anyway.

merge-info has the same behaviour.
